# Machine_Learning_Coursera
This repository is about the Machine Learning Course on Coursera by Andrew Nguyen and contains my submission of weakly exercises.

Projects completed within the course:

  Linear and Logistic Regression
  Logistic neural nets to recognize handwritten digits
  SVM spam classifier
  K-Means clustering for color compression
  PCA to reduce dataset dimensionality (whilst preserving variation in the dataset)
  Multivariate Gaussian Distribution to detect anomalies in a database
